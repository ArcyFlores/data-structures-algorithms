# 🌟 Linked Lists: Introduction and Basics 🌟

This directory introduces **Linked Lists**, a foundational data structure in computer science. Linked Lists consist of nodes connected by pointers, enabling dynamic memory allocation and efficient insertion/deletion operations.

---

## 🔍 **What You’ll Learn**

1. **Define Nodes:** Understand the basic building block of a linked list—a node.
2. **Create a Linked List:** Step-by-step guide to create and link nodes in Python.
3. **Traverse a Linked List:** Learn to navigate and print a linked list.

---

## 🔧 **Code Examples**

- **`linked_lists_intro.py`**: This file demonstrates the basics of creating and traversing a linked list in Python.

---

## 🚀 **How to Run the Code**

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ChicanaCodes/data-structures-algorithms.git
   cd linkedLists
   ```

2. Run the Python file:
   ```bash
   python linked_lists_intro.py
   ```

---

## 🔎 **Example Output**

When you run the file, you will see:

```
Linked List:
1 🤯 2 🤯 3 🤯 null
```

This indicates the nodes in the linked list (1, 2, and 3) connected sequentially, with `null` marking the end of the list.

## 📚 **Key Terms**

| **Term**    | **Definition**                                              |
|-------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Node**    | A single element of a linked list containing data and a pointer. |
| **Head**    | The first node in the linked list.                          |
| **Pointer** | A reference to the next node in the list (or `None`).       |

---

## 📊 **Real-World Applications**

- **Dynamic Data Management**: Used in stacks, queues, and graphs.
- **Undo/Redo Functionality**: Found in text editors and software tools.
- **Memory-Efficient Storage**: Ideal for dynamic memory allocation.

---

## 📢 **Next Steps**

Stay tuned for:

- **Singly Linked Lists:** Detailed operations like insertion, deletion, and searching.
- **Doubly Linked Lists:** Nodes with pointers to both the next and previous elements.
